# Proxy Design Pattern
The Proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder object,
which references a real object. The pattern allows to defer instantiation
of an object until it is needed. This is useful when the lifetime of an
object isn't predictable or can't be managed.

the proxy pattern allows us to create an intermediary that acts as an
interface to another resource and also hiding the underlying complexity
of the componenet.

Proxy means "in place of", 'representing' or 'on behalf of' are literal
meanings of proxy and that directly explains the name of the pattern.

Consider a heavy java Object (like a JDBC connection or a SessionFactory)
that requires some initial configuration

We only want such objects to be created when they are needed, and once
thay are we'd want to reuse them for all calls.
