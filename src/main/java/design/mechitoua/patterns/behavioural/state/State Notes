# State Design Pattern:
The benefit of using State Pattern is to implement polymorphic behavior.
The chances of error are less and it's very easy to add more states for
additional behavior. Thus making our code more robust, easy to maintain
and flexible.

## Use case:
Suppose we want to implement a AC remote with a simple button to perform
action. If the state is ON, it will turn on the AC and if the state is OFF,
it will turn off the AC.
