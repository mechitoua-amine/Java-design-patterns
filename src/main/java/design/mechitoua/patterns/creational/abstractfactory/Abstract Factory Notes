# Abstract Factory Design Pattern:

Abstract Factory Pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern except the fact
that its more like facoty of factories (more generic)

Abstract Factory Pattern is considered another layer of abstraction over Factory
Pattern.

Whenever you need another level of abstraction over a group of factories, you
should consider using the abstract factory pattern.

## Abstract Factory Design Pattern exampes in JDK:
    - java.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory newInstance() method
    - java.xml.transform.TransformerFactory newInstance() method
    - javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory newInstance() method
