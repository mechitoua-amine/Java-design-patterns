# Interpreter Design Pattern:

Interpreter Pattern is used to define a grammatical representation fo a
language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.

The best example of interpreter pattern is the java compiler that
interprets java source code into byte code that is understandable by JVM.

Google translator is also an example of interpreter pattern where the
input can be in any language and we can get the output interpreted in
another language.

# Examples of Interpreter Pattern in JDK:

-   java.util.Pattern and subclasses of java.text.Format
