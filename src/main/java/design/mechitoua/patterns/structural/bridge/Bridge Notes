# Bridge Design Pattern:
When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as implementations
then bridge desing pattern is used to decouple the client progmram.

This design pattern decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the
two can vary independently.

The implementation of bridge pattern follows the notion to favour Composition
over inheritance.

Bridge design pattern can be used when both abstraction and implementation can
have different hierarchies independently and we want to hide the implementation
from the client progmram.
