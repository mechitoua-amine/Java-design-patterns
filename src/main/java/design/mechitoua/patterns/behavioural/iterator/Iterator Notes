# Iterator Desing Pattern

The Iterator pattern is used to privide standard way to travese through
a group of Objests. Iterator pattern is widely used in Java collections

Framework.iterator interface profides methods for traversing through
a collection.

This pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
without exposing its underlying representation.

Iterator Desing Pattern is not only about traversing through a collection
, we can provide different kind of iterators based on our resquirments.

Iterator Pattern hides the actual implementation of traversal through
the collection and client program just use iterator methods.

# Examples of Iterator Design Pattern in JDK

-   All the implemetations of java.util.Iterator interface
-   all implementations of java.util.Enumeration interface
