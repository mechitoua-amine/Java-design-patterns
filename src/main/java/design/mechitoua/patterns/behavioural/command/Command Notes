# Command Design Pattern:

Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral
pattern category. It is used to encapsulate the request and the receiver of the
request. The command pattern is used to decouple the invoker and the receiver
of the request.

A request is wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker object.
Invoker object looks for the appropriate object which can handle this command
and pass it to the corresponding object which executes the command.

# Examples of Command Pattern in JDK:

-   All implementations of java.lang.Runnable interface
-   All implementations of javax.swing.Action
