# Visitor Design Pattern:

Visitor Design Pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns,
it is used when we have to perform an oepration on a group of
similar kinds of objects. With the help of Visitor Pattern, we
can move the oepration logic from the objects to antoher class.

The benefit of this pattern is that if the logic of oepration
changes, then we need to make changes only in the visitor class
rather than doing it in all the classes.

Another benefit is that adding a new class to the system is easy
, it will require changing the visitor inteface and the concrete
class remains the same and will not be affected.

# Example of Visitor Design Pattern in JDK:

-   javax.lang.model.element.AnnotationValue and AnnotationVisitor
-   javax.lang.model.element.Element and ElementVisitor
-   javax.lang.model.type.TypeMirror and TypeVisitor
-   java.nio.file.FileVisitor and SimpleFileVisitor
