# Facade Design Pattern:

This pattern is used to help client applications to easily access
the system components and interact with them.

This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
in a subsystem or system. Facade pattern defines a higher-level
interface that makes the sybsystem easier to use.

# Key points:

    - Facade design pattern is more like a helper for client applications
      , it doesn't hide subsystem interfaces from the client. Whether to
        use facade or not is completely dependent on the client.
    - Facade pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually
        when the number of interfaces grow and the system gets complex.
    - Subsytem interfaces are not aware of Facade and they shouldn't have
      any reference of the facade interface.
    - Facade pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces, its
      purpose is to provide a single interface rather than multiple interfaces
      that does the similar kind of jobs.
