# Prototype Design Pattern:

The Prototype Design Pattern is used when the object creation is costly and requires
alot of time and resources and you have similar object already existing.

Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object
and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern uses java cloning
to copy the object.

## Prototype desing pattern examples in JDK:

java.lang.Object clone() method (the class has to implement java.lang.Clonable)
